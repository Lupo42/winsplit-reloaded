					<h3>Changelog</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Next version</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Added an option for the VirtualNumpad to be dislayed with big icons (useful for touchscreens)</li>
	<li>Added 2 buttons to the Virtual Numpad to send the active window to the left/right screen (only available if a multi-monitors display is detected)</li>
	<li>Added a "Donate" button on the "About" dialog box</li>
	<li>Bug Fix : Wrong registry key used for the "Active Window Tracking" timeout depending on Windows version</li>
	<li>Bug Fix : If the Drag'N'Go modifiers were set to "none" + "none", all activated windows were moved to the last target zone used</li>
	<li>Added 9 new hotkeys ("Win Key" + "Numpad 1 to 9") to simply move the active window (without resizing-it)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>04/12/2011 - v11.04</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Bug Fix : The settings (including the VirtualNumpad position and style) were not saved when WinSplit was closed by the end of the user's session.</li>
	<li>Improvement : The installer and uninstaller language will now be set automatically, regarding the system's language. The registry keys created by the previous installers has been removed, so the "portable mode" won't touch anything in the registry<br>
	<b>[Edit] :</b> The dialog box has been put back, because of bad language detection, but the created registry key is removed in case of portable install mode.</li>
	<li>Bug Fix : The update and/or uninstall process fails because of a dll file that can't be replaced. People will probably still encounter problems to update to this release. If so, there is now a "Cleanup Tool" available in the download page.</li>
	<li>Bug Fix : The message "<b>Impossible to install hooks</b>" was often shown at WinSplit startup, and the checkbox saying "<b>Do not display this message anymore</b>" wasn't working as expected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>03/14/2011 - v11.03</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Bug Fix : The VirtualNumpad position was not correctly saved in some cases.</li>
	<li>Bug Fix : A message was shown (<b>Problem to enumerate all screens</b>) and the "<b>Send to left/right screen</b>" action cancelled if some "invisible mirrored monitors" are installed. Now, only real monitors are taken into account.</li>
	<li>Bug Fix : When launched at Windows startup, messages for communication between the hook system and the main application could not be delivered "in time", so WinSplit thought that there was a problem and was displaying an error message.</li>
	<li>New translations : russian</li>
	<li>Bug Fix : The screenshots folder could not be created under Windows 7 (and probably under windows Vista)</li>
	<li>New : the errors messages saying that hooks were impossible to install can now be desactivated</li>
	<li>Bug fix : the automatic update process could not be launched because of UAC : you'll still have to do the next update manually on some system (Windows Vista and 7)</li>
	<li>Bug fix : the Drag'n'Go functionnality was started even if the corresponding option was unchecked</li>
</ul>
<hr>

	<li>New Hotkeys for "Maximize horizontally" and "Maximize Vertically"</li>
