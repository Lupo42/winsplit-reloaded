# Winsplit Reloaded
A fork of WinSplit Revolution, an advanced window sizer for Windows Vista and newer.

This project recovers the code from the famous project, originally published at developpez.com:

http://projets.developpez.com/projects/winsplit-revolution/

it's version 9.02, publicly released on 2009/02/27.

The current project intends to make the software work for Windows 10's theme, and eventually remove many of its usability idiosincracies.

Fixes and enhancements from versions 11.02, 11.03 and 11.04 have probably been lost, and they would have to be redone.
